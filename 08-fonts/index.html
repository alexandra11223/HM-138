                        using React
                        and the
                        app platform’s
                        native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well
                        as to
                        describe

                        React Native runs on <a class="link" href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for
                        building user
                        interfaces
                        with JavaScript. To make the most of
                        React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
                        as a
                        refresher course.

                    <p class="par">We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React: </p>
                    <ul class="react-fundamentals-li">
                        <li><span class="bold-word">+components</span>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                            in its
                            examples:
                            friendly, approachable
                            creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold-word">+JSX</span>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                            write elements
                            inside
                            JavaScript
                            like so: <code class="backgraund">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="par">
                        The React docs have a <a class="link" href="#">comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to
                        learn even
                        more.
                        Because JSX is JavaScript,
                        you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="backgraund">name</span>
                        for the cat,
                        name, and
                        embedding it with curly
                        braces inside <code class="backgraund">&lt;Text&gt;</code>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="react-fundamentals-li">
                        <li><span class="bold-word">+props</span>. Props is short for “properties”.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold-word">+state</span>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                            configure how
                            components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for
                            handling data that
                            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                            class="stylish">onChangeText</span>
                        prop
                        that takes a function to be
                        called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
                        called when
                        the text is submitted.

                    <p class="par">
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language.
                        In this new language,
                        every single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                        translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
